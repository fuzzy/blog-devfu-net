* Where you are

You are in a small room, surrounded by the rantings of a madman, scribbled onto the walls. Perhaps if
you read them long enough, you may find something worthwhile in them. Perhaps. But beware, as was once
said by Nietzsche: "if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you".

* Who am I?

I am Fuzzy, the humble narrator and curator of the ravings you see before you. Please do not be alarmed
by my resemblance to various australasian land mammals, I assure you, I've had all my shots...at least
people have stabbed me with implements many times.

* Why would you do this?

Well, because I wrote 'smore' which renders Org and Markdown documents to HTML on the fly, and I needed
to make sure there was a valid test case for it. Also because I wanted to. At least I had the decency to
hide my rantings off in a private corner of the internet instead of inflicting them on the world at large.

* Why should I read any of this?

I have no compelling answer for that.
