* [[/emacs/][Emacs]]

Emacs is my development environment of choice. As such, over the years, I've built up a bit of configurations for it.
Not nearly as much as some people I know, and more than others. But regardless I decided to document my configurations
and workflows. I'm doing this for a few reasons. One, it's good to keep in the habit of documenting things. Two, I'm 
getting older. Third, is the hope that someone will see what I'm doing, realize that I'm doing it wrong, and correct me.
