This is exactly what it says on the tin. Using Docker's swarm-mode, Gitea, and DroneCI you can quickly
and easily setup a CI/CD pipeline that will handle anything you throw at it (probably). And you can even
do this on ARM(64)!! Build a cluster on your desk, test your code and deployments for fun and profit!!

* [[/systems/automated-monitoring-with-nagios.org][Automated Monitoring]]

Build out GitOps automated monitoring with Gitea, DroneCI, Ansible, and Docker. Once you standardize on
the checks you want to do, configuring monitoring can be done through an ansible playbook, and a jinja2
template and a CI/CD pipeline. Just add a host to the inventory, add host variables to define what checks
you want, and commit to the repo. It's that simple.
